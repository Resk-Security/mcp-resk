RESK-MCP is an open-source Python library that adds a robust security and management layer over the official [Model Context Protocol (MCP) Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk). It provides enhanced security features, monitoring capabilities, and tools for managing MCP interactions.


## Features


- **JWT Authentication**: Secure MCP server endpoints with JSON Web Tokens
- **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming MCP requests using Pydantic
- **PII Detection**: Basic detection of Personally Identifiable Information in request parameters
- **Prompt Injection Protection**: Detection of common prompt injection phrases
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable per-user or per-IP rate limits using `slowapi`
- **Token-Based Context Management**: Limit request size based on estimated token count
- **Interaction Tracking**: Monitor calls to tools, resources, and prompts
- **Dashboard**: Web-based visualization of MCP interactions and server configuration
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup using environment variables
- **HTTPS Support**: Built-in SSL/TLS configuration

## Installation

```bash
pip install mcp-resk
```

```bash
# Clone the repository (if contributing or running from source)
git clone https://github.com/Resk-Security/mcp-resk.git
cd mcp-resk

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# On Windows
# .\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies using uv (recommended)
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# For development with editable install
uv pip install -e .

# If contributing or running tests
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

> **Note**: We use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as the recommended package installer because it's significantly faster than pip and provides better dependency resolution. It's also used in our CI/CD workflow.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
# Required
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-here"

# Optional configurations
RATE_LIMIT="100/minute"  # Format: "count/period" (e.g., "5/second", "1000/hour")
MAX_TOKEN_PER_REQUEST="4000"
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"

# For HTTPS
# SSL_KEYFILE="./key.pem"
# SSL_CERTFILE="./cert.pem"
```

### ⚠️ JWT Security Warning

The security of your MCP server relies heavily on the strength of your JWT secret:

- **NEVER** use simple, predictable, or default JWT secrets in production
- Use a strong, randomly generated secret with high entropy (at least 32 characters)
- Do not store JWT secrets in your code or commit them to version control
- Rotate JWT secrets periodically in production environments
- Consider using environment-specific secrets for different deployments
- If you suspect a JWT secret has been compromised, rotate it immediately

The `JWT_SECRET` is used to sign and verify all authentication tokens. A compromised secret would allow attackers to forge valid tokens and bypass your authentication system entirely.

## Usage Example

```python
# main.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from resk_mcp import SecureMCPServer, create_jwt_token

load_dotenv()

# Initialize the secure server
server = SecureMCPServer(name="MySecureCalculatorApp")

# Define a sample tool
@server.tool(name="calculator/add")
async def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds two numbers."""
    return a + b

@server.resource(path_pattern="info/version")
async def get_version() -> dict:
    """Returns the application version."""
    return {"version": "1.0-secure"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Generate a test token
    jwt_secret = os.getenv("JWT_SECRET")
    if not jwt_secret:
        print("Error: JWT_SECRET not found. Please set it in .env file.")
        exit(1)
    
    test_user_id = "user@example.com"
    token = create_jwt_token(user_id=test_user_id, secret_key=jwt_secret)
    print(f"Test Token: Bearer {token}\n")

    # Start the server
    ssl_key_path = os.getenv("SSL_KEYFILE")
    ssl_cert_path = os.getenv("SSL_CERTFILE")
    
    if ssl_key_path and ssl_cert_path:
        server.run_server(port=8001, ssl_keyfile=ssl_key_path, ssl_certfile=ssl_cert_path)
    else:
        server.run_server(port=8001)
```

## Troubleshooting

### JWT Authentication: "Signature verification failed"

If you encounter `WARNING:resk_mcp.server:Authentication failed for /mcp_secure: Invalid token: Signature verification failed` errors when running test_client.py against example_server.py, it means the JWT (JSON Web Token) sent by the client could not be verified by the server. This almost always indicates a mismatch in the JWT_SECRET used to sign the token (client-side or how the token was originally generated) and the JWT_SECRET used by the server to verify it.

#### How JWT Authentication is Setup in this Example:

**Server-Side (example_server.py):**

- The server relies on a JWT_SECRET for signing and verifying tokens.
- This secret is primarily configured via a .env file at the root of the project. The resk_mcp/config.py module loads this secret into the application's settings (settings.jwt_secret).
- When example_server.py starts, it generates a test JWT using this settings.jwt_secret and prints it to the console. This is the token your test_client.py should be using.

**Client-Side (test_client.py):**

- The test_client.py has a hardcoded AUTH_TOKEN variable.
- This token is sent in the Authorization header for requests to the secure MCP endpoint.

#### The Mismatch:

The "Signature verification failed" error occurs if the AUTH_TOKEN in test_client.py was not generated using the exact same JWT_SECRET that example_server.py is currently configured with (via its .env file).

#### How to Fix It:

**Ensure JWT_SECRET is Configured for the Server:**

1. Create a file named .env in the root directory of this project (e.g., alongside example_server.py).
2. Add your desired secret key to it:
   ```
   JWT_SECRET="your_very_strong_and_unique_secret_key_here"
   ```
3. Important: If you change this secret, any previously generated tokens (including the one in test_client.py) will become invalid.

**Run the Server (example_server.py):**

Execute `python example_server.py`.

**Copy the Correct Token from Server Logs:**

1. Look for a log message from the server similar to this:
   ```
   INFO:example-server:Token de test généré (utilisant JWT_SECRET du .env): eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...[long_token_string]...
   ```
   (The message might be slightly different if you changed the log language/format, but it will contain the generated token.)
2. Carefully copy the entire token string (it's usually very long).

**Update test_client.py:**

1. Open test_client.py.
2. Find the line:
   ```python
   AUTH_TOKEN = "some_old_or_incorrect_token_here"
   ```
3. Replace the old token string with the new token you just copied from the server logs.
   ```python
   AUTH_TOKEN = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...[the_new_long_token_string_you_copied]..."
   ```

**Run the Client (test_client.py):**

Now, execute `python test_client.py`.
The authentication errors should be gone, and your client should be able to communicate with the server successfully.

**Key Takeaway:** The AUTH_TOKEN used by the client must be a token that was signed with the exact same JWT_SECRET that the server is currently using for verification. The easiest way to ensure this in this example setup is to always use the token printed by example_server.py on startup.

## Detailed Configuration

RESK-MCP uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following (at a minimum):

```env
# .env
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-here"

# Rate Limiting (default: "100/minute")
# Examples: "5/second", "1000/hour", "20/day"
RATE_LIMIT="100/minute"

# Optional for HTTPS:
# SSL_KEYFILE="./key.pem"
# SSL_CERTFILE="./cert.pem"

# Optional for context management and logging:
# MAX_TOKEN_PER_REQUEST="4000"
# LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
```

- **JWT_SECRET**: A strong, random secret key for signing JWT tokens. This is critical for security.
- **RATE_LIMIT**: Defines the rate limit for requests. The format is count/period (e.g., 100/minute, 5/second). Defaults to 100/minute. Rate limiting is primarily based on the user_id from the JWT, falling back to IP address if the token is invalid or missing.
- **SSL_KEYFILE**: Path to your SSL private key file (e.g., key.pem).
- **SSL_CERTFILE**: Path to your SSL certificate file (e.g., cert.pem).
- **MAX_TOKEN_PER_REQUEST**: Approximate maximum tokens allowed per request (default: 4000).
- **LOG_LEVEL**: Logging level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, default: INFO).

### Generating SSL Certificates (for HTTPS)

For local development, you can generate self-signed certificates using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

For production, obtain certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) like Let's Encrypt.
